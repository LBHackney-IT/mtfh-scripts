Scripts for use within Modern Tools For Housing

### NOTE:

These Python commands may be different depending on your OS and how you installed Python.

Try `python` instead of `python3` if you get "command not found".

## Requirements

1. A recent version of [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (e.g. Python 3.11)
2. The Pip package manager for Python 3. Try `python3 -m pip --version` to see if you have it installed. If not,
   try `python3 -m ensurepip` to install it.

## Setup / Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Make a venv (local package directory) with `python3 -m venv venv`
3. Activate the venv
    - Linux / MacOS: Run `source venv/bin/activate`
    - Windows: Run `./venv/bin/activate.bat` or `./venv/bin/activate.ps1` depending on what's available
3. Optionally verify the venv is active:
    - Linux / MacOS: Run `which python3` and check it points to the venv
    - Windows: Run `where.exe python3` and check it points to the venv
4. Run `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt` in the root directory of the repository to install all requirements
   into the venv.

## Setup / AWS

Install the [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html) -
the scripts use AWS CLI profile based authentication to make calls to AWS.

You'll need a recent version of the AWS CLI to make connections to databases via port forwarding as this is a new feature.

You can follow these steps multiple times to set up different profiles for different AWS accounts:

1. Go to the Google SSO AWS start page and select "Command line or programmatic access" for the account needed.
2. Note the steps under **AWS IAM Identity Center credentials (Recommended)** and use those details below.
3. Run `aws configure sso` and follow the prompts to set up your AWS credentials.
   Refer to the Stage enum in `aws/src/enums/enums.py` as it must exactly match one of these.
   Add to the enum as needed for different profiles.
4. To refresh your credentials when they expire, run `aws sso login --profile {profile_name}`

You will need to refresh your credentials as in step 4 when commands fail, usually with a message
like `Error when retrieving token from sso: Token has expired and refresh failed`

## Running scripts

You should not need further dependencies to run any scripts.

1. Open the `use_cases.py` file in the root directory of the repository.
2. Click into the functions you want to run and set the Config objects in the files to match your needs.
3. Call the function in the main section of the `use_cases.py` file.
4. Run `python3 use_cases.py` in the root directory of the repository to run the script.

This is done from the use_cases.py file to ensure that imports are relative to the root directory of the repository.

## Running tests

Tests are in Pytest which is installed as a dependency

1. Open the directory of the test files to run
2. Run `pytest {test_file_name}.py` to run tests in a file or just `pytest` to run all tests
